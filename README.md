# Project 3: Around The U.S

The third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. This project was created using HTML and CSS, based on the figma design.

## Project features

- HTML5
- Flexbox
- Figma
- Positioning with grid
- Forms
- VS code
- BEM file structure
- GitBash

## Plan on improving the project

I would like to be able to add onto the project and figure out a way I can create a form that others can add pictures to the website, along with thier own profiles. I also would like to add an animation that changes the like button to grow and/or change in style once it it clicked by the user.
